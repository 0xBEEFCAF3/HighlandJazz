		We open our 35th season with an unforgettable concert celebrating the collaboration of composers Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn. Greg Hopkins, the Motor City-born trumpeter, arranger and bandleader, brings an all-star contingent to the Highland Jazz stage to perform the tunes of two men whose body of jazz work forever changed the world of music. Considered among America's greatest composers, Ellington and Strayhorn used the medium of the big band to craft memorable tunes such as, "It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)," "Take The A-Train," "Sophisticated Lady, "Lush Life," and "In A Sentimental Mood." Hopkins, the former arranger and trumpeter with the Billy Maxted and Buddy Rich orchestras, has the perfect touch to bring the energy and passion of "Duke and Strays" alive for novice and experienced jazz lovers alike. Rounding out the Sextet + 1 are Shannon LeClarie (alto sax/flute), Arnie Krakowski (tenor sax), Jeff Galindo (trombone), Tim Ray (piano), John Lockwood (bass) and Joe Hunt (drums)</p>

They represent the extensive depth of Israel’s musicianship as he continues to evolve as a leader.. High Standards, Israel's jazz quartet, includes Lance Bryant (saxophone), Henry Lugo (bass) and Laszlo Gardony (piano), whom Jazz Times hailed as "one of contemporary music's truly original voices."  Gardony will be spotlighted in a set celebrating his soulful new solo piano CD, "Serious Play"  (Sunnyside) with music from the recording including ", "Naima," , "Over The Rainbow," and "Georgia On My Mind" as well as his spontaneous, inspired improvisations which come from a deep well of emotion and compassion.

Saxophonist Bill Pierce has enjoyed a long and distinguished career as a performer and music educator. A Berklee faculty member for over two decades, Pierce has performed with such  indisputable masters of jazz as Freddie Hubbard, Tony Williams, Art Farmer, Hank Jones, James Williams and Art Blakey. Pierce's sinewy tenor and soprano saxophone lines can be heard on 70 albums on which he was a sideman and on 11 of his own recordings. From an early age, he listened to Dave Brubeck, John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley. As a Berklee student in the late 1960s Pierce immersed himself in music, studying jazz during the day and performing at night. For two years he gigged at the Sugar Shack, a Boston nightclub that drew many of the top R&B acts. He performed briefly with Steve Wonder, toured for almost three years as a member of Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers and teamed up with legendary drummer Tony Williams, with whom he made five recordings.

			Pianist Daniela Schächter started early her musical career: by her mid-teens was already performing publicly in Sicily, Italy, as well as doing studio session work. After her classical studies she moved to Boston as recipient of a scholarship to the Berklee College of Music, where she studied with Phil Wilson, Joe Lovano, Hal Crook and Joanne Brackeen. Schächter has won many prestigious awards, including the Mary Lou Williams Jazz Piano Competition, The Sister in Jazz Competition and the Betty Carters Jazz Ahead Competition. Her 2016 recording, <b>"Vanheusenism: A Tribute to Jimmy Van Heusen,"</b> celebrates the work of the renowned songwriter best known for Great American Songbook standards such as "All the Way,” “Darn That Dream,” “Here’s That Rainy Day,” and “Come Fly With Me." "It is arranged and performed with precisely the correct mix of homage and invention," wrote Downbeat's Simon Scott. "A worthy tribute for one great artist—from another." Schächter's band features saxophonist Mike Tucker, bassist Mark O’Brien and drummer Mark Walker.

				<h4>About us</h4>
				<p>Highland Jazz has presented over 200 concerts over the past 34 years. While our venues in and around

Newton, MA have changed since our launch in 1983, we have established ourselves as the oldest,

continuous, community-based jazz series in New England. This is an exemplary accomplishment since

most of the non-profit jazz organizations which were flourishing then have disappeared from the scene.
	<br />
Our concerts have spanned the range of mainstream acoustic jazz, bebop, swing, latin american, blues,

gospel and dixieland. These have featured the most talented and respected musicians in New England

and elsewhere. We have showcased emerging artists from New England Conservatory and Berklee

School of Music as they began their professional journeys and broadened our audience reach. We have

also enabled youngsters from local middle and high schools to open our concerts and gain an early

connection to professional musicians and a discerning jazz audience. In doing so, we are extremely

proud to have served as a platform for the musicians who have gone on to national and international

acclaim.
	<br />
Please check out our<a href="http://highlandjazzmemories.wordpress.com"> Highland Jazz Memories Blog </a> on this page where you will encounter our glorious

history in song and story. These have been assiduously and lovingly compiled by my predecessor, Nancy

Alimansky, and is now available as an eBook. Come live the memories and share the music. Help us

continue the tradition. Become part of our living history.</p>
