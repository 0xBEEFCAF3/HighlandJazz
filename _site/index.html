				<h4>Welcome</h4>
				<p>
"A warm welcome to our 34th annual jazz series where great music and great times are assured. We have added a new change to our series this season with a full lineup of Sunday afternoon only concerts at Newton South, Sundays@South. This is a departure from our usual Saturday evening programs and is aimed at accommodating many of you who prefer to attend daytime concerts and avoid night time driving. Concert-goers will continue to enjoy two sets of music for the price of one, free parking, comfortable seating, unimpeded sight lines, available refreshments, but most-of- all, an exceptional lineup of talented musicians ready to satisfy their every jazz appetite. We open on Sunday, September 11, with “A Parris Afternoon” featuring Newton’s native Rebecca Parris, Boston’s First Lady of Jazz. She will be accompanied by Chris Taylor, piano, Peter Kontrimas, bass, and Jim Lattini, drums. Next up on Sunday, November 20 is pianist Laszlo Gardony, who JazzTimes called “one of contemporary music’s original voices”, with an all-star Berklee sextet comprised of saxophonists Bill Pierce and Stan Strickland, John Lockwood, bass, Yoron Israel, drums, and introducing special guest, saxophonist Marco Pignataro. The sextet celebrates Gardony’s latest CD release “In Real Time”. We return on Sunday, April 2, 2017 with “Strike Up The Band” starring Newton’s own, Paul Broadnax, the venerable pianist, vocalist and his regulars, Peter Kontrimas on bass and Les Harris, Jr. on drums. They are joined by the fluid sounds of saxophonist Fred Haas and extra added attraction, vocalist Eula Lawrence. Our season finale on Sunday, May 7, “Newton’s Best”, spotlights an array of Newton’s finest jazz artists in ensemble groupings including Cercie Miller, saxophone, vocalists Dominique Eade and Lisa Thorson, Alan Chase, saxophone, and George Schuller, drums accompanied by Boston all-stars, pianist Tim Ray, piano and John Lockwood, bass,. Their appearance highlights the 2017 Newton Festival of the Arts, a robust, two-month long calendar of arts and cultural events taking place throughout the Garden City."<br /> Hank Solomon, Managing Director </p>

			Boston's First Lady of Jazz, <b>Rebecca Parris</b>, launches our 34th season series backed by <b>Chris Taylor</b>(piano),<b>Peter Kontrimas</b>(bass) and <b> Jim Lattini </b>
			(drums). The Grammy-nominated jazz vocalist returns to her Newton roots bearing her distinctive interpretation of the Great American Songbook and her stylistic take on
			lesser-known compositions. Parris began her professional career singing with top 40s band across the Northeast before discovering her passion in jazz. Since then, she has performance all over the world
			with her own groups, as well as with some of jazz's greatest legends, including Dizzy Gillespie, Buddy Rich, Woody Herman, Terry Gibbs, David "Fathead" Newman, Norman Simmons, Harold Jones,
			Andy Simpkins, Gerry Wiggins, Bill Cunliffe, Red Mitchell, Buster Cooper and Nat Pierce and many others. Parris' second passion is teaching, both in private, one-on-one sessions and workshops.
			A master clinician, Parris is a 10-time winner of The Boston Music Award for Outstanding Jazz Vocalist and producer.</p>

			Our 2016/17 series finale spotlights an array of some of Newton's Best jazz artist in ensemble groupings. Vocalists <b> Dominique Eade </b> and <b> Lisa Thorson </b> and saxophonist <b> 
			Cercie Miller </b> and <b> Allan Chase </b> will be accompanied by an esteemed
			rhythm section consisting of Tim Ray, piano, John Lockwood, bass, and another Newton native,
			<b> Geroge Schuller </b>, drums. Leading her own quartel since 1986, Miller has been called a "Versatile stylist with a penchant for melody as well as take no streak
			that shows itself on her slashing alto solos"[Boston Herald]. Eade has been named an "impossibly versatile vocalist, composer, lyricist, and intrumental arranger..."(New York Times Magazine).
			Thorson, a popular vocalist and music educator, was hailed by legendary vocalist Sheila Jordan as 
			"one of the most exciting singers on the jazz scene today". Chase appears on over 40 recordings as a
			jazz saxophonist and as a soloist on contemporary classical, new music, rock, and pop recordings. Their combined 
			appearances highlight the 2017 Newton Festival of the Arts, a two-month long calendar of arts and

				<h4>About us</h4>
				<p>Highland Jazz has presented over 200 concerts over the past 33 years. While our venues in and around

Newton, MA have changed since our launch in 1983, we have established ourselves as the oldest,

continuous, community-based jazz series in New England. This is an exemplary accomplishment since

most of the non-profit jazz organizations which were flourishing then have disappeared from the scene.
	<br />
Our concerts have spanned the range of mainstream acoustic jazz, bebop, swing, latin american, blues,

gospel and dixieland. These have featured the most talented and respected musicians in New England

and elsewhere. We have showcased emerging artists from New England Conservatory and Berklee

School of Music as they began their professional journeys and broadened our audience reach. We have

also enabled youngsters from local middle and high schools to open our concerts and gain an early

connection to professional musicians and a discerning jazz audience. In doing so, we are extremely

proud to have served as a platform for the musicians who have gone on to national and international

acclaim.
	<br />
Please check out our<a href="http://highlandjazzmemories.wordpress.com"> Highland Jazz Memories Blog </a> on this page where you will encounter our glorious

history in song and story. These have been assiduously and lovingly compiled by my predecessor, Nancy

Alimansky, and is now available as an eBook. Come live the memories and share the music. Help us

continue the tradition. Become part of our living history.</p>
